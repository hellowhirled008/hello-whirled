### Welcome to the official Hello Whirled website! Hello Whirled is the (usually)-one-man musical project of Benjamin Spizuco. Hi. I'm Ben. I've never built a website before. I don't know what I'm doing.

# Stay tuned. Everything below is groundwork.


This takes you to the website blog. It's where I post news and updates.

This takes you to a discography page. It lists every Hello Whirled release with listening links, tracklists, and perhaps even some bonus info.

This takes you to a video page. Hello Whirled videos live here.

This is sort of a bonus page. I might put non-HW stuff here that pertains more to "Ben Spizuco" than "Hello Whirled". Who knows?
