As of right now, there are 4 completed No Victories EPs, with a 5th in the works.
I bought a Yamaha Reface CS and really like it, so I'm going to try to use it a lot because I've spent a ton of money on gear recently and I want to get my money's worth.

There's a side project in the works that will warrant the first Ben Spizuco album of the year. It sounds nothing like Hello Whirled. More to follow.
