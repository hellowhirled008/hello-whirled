Well this site was kind of a bust, huh. I should probably save up some more money to justify getting Squarespace or something. Anyway, I have a new album coming out in 8 days. https://hellowhirled.bandcamp.com/album/history-worth-repeating

Album's done. It comes out in a week. Cheers.

A lot has happened in the last few weeks. Six songs have been completed for No Victories. One song ("No One I Want") was axed, and has been replaced with one of the bonus tracks ("Chariot") as well as a HW song from 2020 that never got the credit it deserved ("Easily Entertained").

In related news, the first single "It's Just You" will be released on streaming platforms (and YouTube) on April 14! So that's cool.

Been a while huh. I'm planning on officially announcing the website today. All 8 No Victories EPs are done. Of the 35 songs recorded, 15 were selected to be re-mixed for the album. My plan is to start mixing on April 1 so I can spend the rest of March finishing up the Damp Socks Ensemble so I can call it done.

I included 7 non-album-phase tracks on the No Victories "Rough Mixes" page, as well as on the Google Form I made for it. The songs are marked as "bonus tracks" but if 10 people think a bonus track is worth salvaging, I should at least look into it if it's proven to be a hit.

My headphones broke two weeks ago during the recording of EP6. I still don't have replacement headphones, so I haven't recorded much. My plan has shifted. There won't be 10 EPs, there will be 8 (9 if things go really well), and they'll all be out before April. They might not be 10 minutes long anymore, just for time purposes. The entire month of April will be devoted to the "album phase", where the best EP tracks will be re-mixed for a more proper release. The album should be done on April 30 for a May 14 release.

Belted Kingfisher has been postponed, but it will happen.

As of right now, there are 6 completed No Victories EPs. There is now an hour of recorded music going into the project.

No other news to report.

As of right now, there are 5 completed No Victories EPs, with a 6th in the works.
This marks the halfway point of the preliminary No Victories process. After 10 EPs are recorded, I will take my favorite tracks and re-mix them to be proper for the album.

The side project is called Belted Kingfisher. The album will be out in March.

The 2nd Damp Socks Ensemble EP will be out in April, maybe earlier. It will feature new guests that weren't on the first EP. I'm sad it couldn't become an album but them's the brakes.

As of right now, there are 4 completed No Victories EPs, with a 5th in the works.
I bought a Yamaha Reface CS and really like it, so I'm going to try to use it a lot because I've spent a ton of money on gear recently and I want to get my money's worth.

There's a side project in the works that will warrant the first Ben Spizuco album of the year. It sounds nothing like Hello Whirled. More to follow.
