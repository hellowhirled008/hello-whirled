Despite what my music may indicate, I actually like things. Fun. Games. They live here. Yay.

<https://tiermaker.com/create/hello-whirled-releases-ranked-827974> Rank every Hello Whirled album/EP/comp/outtakes/covers/etc! Will be updated as new music is released.

<http://immovation.immtcnj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bright-Red-Pendant.html> I helped make this Twine game for an event a while back. It's not Hello Whirled but it's a game and it's fun and I made it. If I was Tony Wilson or Mark Robinson, I'd give it a HW catalog number.
